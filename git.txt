Hey there guys! By the time you see this I believe you are already inclined to as per what git is all about, this is just to brush things up(steps).
Now let's  head to the steps involved in connecting our version system control
1. Open your commnd prompt, git bash or whichever you use.
2. Make sure it is connected to your github account.
3. If you are trying to connect to a certain project, go to your github account and click on the project
4. When you are in the project, click on code and get the https link
5. when you have gotten the link go to your command prompt and write "git clone (paste the link you copied beside)"
6. Click enter
7. It will clone automatically, then after that change your working directory to the repository using the "cd" command 
8. You can now create your own files
9. After creating our own files and making changes, you can then add it to the staging directory using the "git add ." command
10. After that you commit to the local repository using the "git commit -m" command , you can also write a string of words beside the command to indicate what you commited
11. Then after a successful commitment, you can then push it to the remote repository, using the "git push" command.

note: Others will do the same and get similar results although they will only need to pull to see changes
